# MEW Popup
`<mew-popup />`

## Overview
The MEW popup component is used to confirm an action. 
The component is triggered open by setting the prop **show** to true.
The component takes a **title** string prop, which is displayed as the header, and uses a default slot to 
set the content.
 There are two actions buttons that are shown at the bottom of the popup - these buttons are 
 set and enabled by the **leftBtn** prop and **rightBtn** prop. These objects take a text,
 color, and method attribute. The right btn also has an *enabled* attribute as well.
