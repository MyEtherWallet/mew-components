# MEW Checkbox 
`<mew-checkbox />`

## Overview
The mew-checkbox component provides a way for users to select between different values. 
There is a slot called **contentSlot** that is used to place customizable content to the right of the checkbox. There is an option to change 
the color of the label text by passing a class through the **className** prop. There is an **id** prop that is used to distinguish an unique
checkbox, which can be used for when 
mew-checkbox is found in a loop. When the checkbox is set, there is an event called **input** that will be emitted with the value and id as the params.
