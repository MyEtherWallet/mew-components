# MEW Module

`<mew-module />`

## Overview

The MEW module component is used mainly as a template to display information.
This is currently being used on the dashboard and wallet pages.
There are many optional props so it can be customized to fit your needs.
The **colorType** prop takes a string and is the color that will be displayed in the background.
The colors that can be used are found in MEWColors. The **title** prop takes a string and is the header of the template.
The **titleSize** takes a string and a size class that can be found in MEWTypography.
This is so you can adjust the title to the required size.
The **subtitle** prop takes a string and will be found on top of the title prop.
The **caption** prop takes a string as well and will be found under the title prop.
You can add an icon next to the title by passing the img source to the **icon** prop (this may change).
The **iconAlign** prop allows you to set the icon to the left or right of the title. You must pass this as a string.
The **hasIndicator** prop takes a boolean and adds a green vertical marker to the left side of the template. Last but not least,
the **hasElevation** prop takes a boolean and adds elevation to the component.
