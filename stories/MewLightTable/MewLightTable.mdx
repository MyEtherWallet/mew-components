# MEW Table
`<mew-light-table />`

## Overview
The MEW table component uses Vuetify's v-data-table but is customized with MEW theme styles.
The **hasColor** prop changes the tables background color to *superPrimary darken1* and the **hasSelect** prop
will add a checkbox to each row. The events **selectedAll** or **selectedRow** will be emitted with the item when
the checkboxes are selected. There are different style customizations for the following values:
 toggle, txHash, token, change, balance, callToAction, and 
address. All you have to do is pass the value and attribute to **tableHeaders** and **tableData**. If you would like to 
utilize the skeleton loading state then you must pass the **loading** prop and you must pass an empty array
to **tableData**.
