# MEW Tabs

`<mew-tabs />`

## Overview

The MEW tabs component uses Vuetify's v-tabs with acceptable MEW theme options. It is used to
show content behind a selectable item. It uses a slot called **tabItemContent** + **number of tab**, i.e. _tabItemContent1_ to
display each tabs content within the container. There is also an option to display content
outside of the tab container by using **tabContent** + **number of tab**, i.e. _tabContent1_.
You may change the colors by passing a string to **activeColor** or **background**.
There is also an option to make the tabs vertical instead of horitzontal and that is set by passing true
to the **isVertical** prop. Each tab title is set by the **items** prop which takes an array of objects that just require the name.
