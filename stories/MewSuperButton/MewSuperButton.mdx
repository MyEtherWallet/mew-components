# MEW Super Button 
`<mew-super-button />`

## Overview

The mew-super-button component is a flex action component that allows you to create a custom button with several text and icon options. There are 2 layout options, row (default) and column. 
There is a minimum content height of 160px, but you can adjust the height according to the enclosing container height. The width of the component is dependent on the layout option. In the row layout, the width is 100% to the enclosing container, while in the column layout, the width will be determined by the content inside.

Currently in MEW V6 you can find examples of the mew-super-button on access/create wallet, the dapp center pages, and in the wallet settings module.


## Usage
(include Infographic)

The MEW super button layout accommodates 4 text options:  title, subtitle, tag, and note. A note will be placed on top of the icon container, and will not be displayed if a right-icon is set. Note that prop is only present in the default layout (row layout), and should only be used for warning purposes. There are 2 icons that you can include for the button: title-icon and right-icon. Please see the example below.

You also have an option to include custom content with the contentSlot to the right of the button text. Please see the example below.

MEW theme options include: primary, basic, and outline. Outline has a white border color and a transparent background, basic has a white background color, and primary has a light green background.
