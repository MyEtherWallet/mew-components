# MEW Super Button Docs

The mew-super-button component allows you to create a custom button with several text and icons options. It also can take a slot (slot name) on the right side of the component instead of the icon. 
*note 
Commonly used to direct to a dapp./method of access

## Usage
Super MEW button layout accommodates 3 text options:  title, subtitle tag and note. A note will be placed on top of the icon container and will not be displayed if an icon is set. 

There are two options to display icons: a small icon on the right side from the title (titleIcon prop) and an icon or an image on the right side of the component (rightIcon prop).

You also have an option to include custom content with the (slot name)  slot. This content will be positioned to the right of the component instead of the icon container.

*is-new prop is dedicated to display a label for a new feature. If you are including a pull request with new feature implementation set this to true.
