# MEW Alert
`<mew-alert />`

## Overview

The mew-alert component is used to display different types of alerts, such as: error, warning, success, and info. The type of alert shown is determined by the **theme** prop. It is very customizable 
due to the default **slot** that can be used in lieu of the **text** and **description** prop. There are also options to hide the icons as well. You may pass the **link-obj** prop to add a link
at the end of the description.
