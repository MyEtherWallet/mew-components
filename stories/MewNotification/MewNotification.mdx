# MEW Notification

`<mew-notification />`

## Overview

The MEW notification component is used to display transaction details to the user. This component takes one object prop, **notification**, to display all of the essential information, which includes: txHash (transaction hash), gasPrice, gasLimit, total (total transaction fee), from, amount (the amount being sent/received), timestamp, status (success, pending, error) , type (in, out, swap). You must pass each object a **value** (the value of each type) and a **string**, which is just the title that will be displayed to describe the value, i.e. notification: { “status”: {“value”: “pending”, “string”: “Status”}}.
