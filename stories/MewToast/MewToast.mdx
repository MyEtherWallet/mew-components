# MEW Toast
`<mew-toast />`

## Overview
The Toast component is used to present a one-time notification to the user. The component is a bottom sheet that has a short message. The message will disappear after several seconds. The component also supports persistent view if the **persistent** prop is set to true. The **can-close** prop will display a button to the right of the component, which will allow a user to manually close the sheet. The **duration** prop determines how long the sheet is shown to the user in milliseconds. Please use a minimum of 5 seconds. The **toast-type** prop determines the background color, and icon that will be shown to the user. <br />
The Toast component takes 2 text options. The **text** prop will display simple text, while the **linkObj** prop displays a link on the toast message. The link can be used on itâ€™s own or together with the text prop. It will always follow the text to the right side.
