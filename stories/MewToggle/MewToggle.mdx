# MEW Toggle
`<mew-toggle />`

## Overview
The MEW Toggle Button component is a group of buttons used to filter specific data to the user. 
It is mainly used to filter dates and percentages.
 It takes 2 props: **buttonType** and **buttonGroup**. There are 3 possible button types, which are custom, default, and percentage. 
 *Default* is used to filter dates, and it has a blue background (named `blue500` in the MEW color palette) during the active state. 
 *Percentage* is used to filter out percentages of a value and shows a green border (named `primary` in the MEW color palette) during the active state.
  *Custom* is selected when a user wants to use a custom button style, and it is created by using slots (**btn** + **number of btn**), i.e. *btn1*. The **buttonGroup** prop
   is used to pass the title for each button. It takes an array of strings.
