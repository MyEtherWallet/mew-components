# MEW Blockie
The mew-blockie component is used to display the circular Ethereum address identicon,
 which is used to identify that the user is using or sending to the correct address. This component has several props. The correct ethereum address string prop is required in order to display the information. The currency prop is used to show a small currency icon within the identicon.
