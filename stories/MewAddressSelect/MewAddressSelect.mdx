# MEW Address Select
`<mew-address-select />`

## Overview

The mew-address-select component is used to set, save and display addresses - it is shown as both an input field and dropdown. The input field only accepts addresses and will error if it is an invalid value - this state is passed in by the **is-valid-address** and **rules** prop. Error messages to be displayed are passed in by the 
**error-messages** prop. The **items** prop contains all the values that will be displayed by the dropdown. Currently on myetherwallet.com, it is used to display all the addresses that are stored in the address book.
The two icons on the right of the input allow options to copy and to save a value to the dropdown. An event named **saveAddress** is emitted when the save address icon is clicked. The copy icon can be hidden by the **showCopy** prop.
If it is a valid address then the address blockie (mew-blockie) will appear on the left.
