# MEW Copy Container 
`<mew-copy />`

## Overview
The mew-copy component provides a way for users to copy specific values to their clipboard. 
There is a slot called **contentSlot** that can be used to place customizable content to the right of the box. There is an option to change 
the color of the label text by passing a class through the **className** prop. There is an **id** prop that is mainly used to distinguish each
copy for when 
mew-copy is found in a loop. When the copy is set, there is an event called **input** that will be emitted with the value and id as the params.
