# MEW Info Card

`<mew-info-card />`

## Overview

MEW Info Card component is used to display information in a rounded container with a box shadow. There are props
you may pass or if you would like to customize it, there are slots as well. The **title** prop is displayed as the
header and there is a **titleIconContainer** slot where you may insert customized icons to be displayed next to the title. The **icon**
prop takes a src url and displays on top of the title.
The **desc** prop is shown as the subtitle and if you would like to also customize this area, you may use the **desc** slot.
The **link** obj prop is used to display a link but if you would like to add custom buttons here, you may use the
**buttonContainer** slot. The last slot that we have is the **cardImg** slot which is used to place a
custom image at the bottom of the card.
