# MEW Text Area

`<mew-text-area />`

## Overview

The MEW text area component uses Vuetify's v-textarea but is customized with MEW theme styles.
It is used to collect large amounts of textual data from an user. When the user types in information,
an event called **input** will be emitted with the value. You may also validate this component by
passing validation rules to the **rules** prop.
