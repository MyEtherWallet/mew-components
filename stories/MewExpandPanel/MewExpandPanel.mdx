# MEW Expand Panel

`<mew-expand-panel />`

## Overview

The mew-expand-panel component provides a way to organize and display different information to users. There are two different color themes, grey and white.
The color theme is controlled by the **isGreyTheme** prop. The **isAccordion** prop removes the margins around the panels so it will share one border if passed true.
You can control which panel is expanded by passing an array of the indexes to the **idxToExpand** prop. Each panel body is customizable and is set by passing a slot, **panelBody** + **the panel number** (index + 1) - i.e. _panelBody1_.
You can set the header title of each panel by passing an obj with the **name** attribute to the **panelItems** array. This will also let the component know how many panels there are. If you would like text next to the toggle button,
then pass a string to the **toggleTitle** attribute in the same panelItems obj.
