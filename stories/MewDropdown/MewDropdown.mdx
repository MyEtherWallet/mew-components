# MEW Dropdown

`<mew-dropdown />`

## Overview

The mew-dropdown component pops up a custom card that is activated by a button. The card will also open if the prop **isOpened** is set to true.
The activator button text is set by the slot name **activatorBtnText**.
The content of the card is customizable and uses the slot **cardContent** to place styles and text. The **popupTitle** prop is optional but will display
as the header if a string is passed.
