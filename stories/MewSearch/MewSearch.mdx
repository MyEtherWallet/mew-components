# MEW Search
`<mew-search />`

## Overview
The MEW search component is a Vuetify text field that is used to enter text for search queries. You may add 
a menu to the end of the input with the **menuSelect** prop. This prop expects the following attributes: 
label and items (which takes an array of objects that contains the names and values). The **isSearchBlock**, **isFilled**
and **isCompact** props will change the input styles based on what you pass to it. You may also pass error messages 
to the **errorMessages** prop.
