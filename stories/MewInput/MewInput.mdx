# MEW Input
`<mew-input />`

## Overview
MEW Input component replaces the Vuetify v-text-field with acceptable MEW theme options. 
This input can be used in different scenarios - all you have to do is pass the type
to the **type** prop. The main two types we use are text and password. Passing a password type will
automatically hide the input text and will add a button icon on the right that toggles whether or not the input text is shown. 
There is an option to hide this icon with the **hidePasswordIcon** prop. <br />
Users will also use this input to enter their address or address name. If its valid, a blockie icon will 
be prepended to the input if **showBlockie** is true 
and if it is an address name, then the resolved address can be shown at the bottom of the input
with the **resolvedAddr** prop. You will also have to pass the resolved addr in order to show the correct blockie.
 There are also options to prepend images and to do this, 
you can pass the src url to the **image** prop - this image will be contained in a mew-token-container component 
or you may use the **prependInnerIcon** slot
to add your own customized icon or image. <br />
Users will also use this input field to set number values. There is a **maxBtnObj** prop that 
takes a title, method, and disabled attribute. If this is passed then a button will be shown on the right and
we currently use this button on MEW to set the max amount allowed on the input. <br />
You can set error messages or hints at the bottom of the input by using the **errorMessages**, **rules**, or **hint** props.
