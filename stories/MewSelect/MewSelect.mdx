## Overview
MEW select replaces Vuetify's v-select with acceptable MEW theme options. It is used as a way to collect 
information from a list of options. There are two main styles to this component, one which is the default style
and the other which will show more customized options like adding a filter or icon. This is enabled by the 
**isCustom** prop. This style is mainly used to display tokens in the wallet pages.
